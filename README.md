# homework-assignment-1
The website for Horiseon was modified to enhance accessbility, as well to improve the source code making it more streamlined and efficient. 
The site uses flex containers to replicate the exisitng website and allow for increased accessability to those users on smaller screens (less than 1170px)
CSS code is broken into groups and commented on the section that it applies to. 
HTML code has semantic elements, working links and alt text added to images.
